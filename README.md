All the tasks that are given in Internship . (GRIP at The Sparks Foundation)

Tasks and Their Descriptions:

Task 1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

          ● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
          ● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
          ● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
          ● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
          ● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 
          
Task 2 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)

          ● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
          ● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
          ● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
          
Task 3 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)

          ● Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
          ● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
          ● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com
          ● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
          ● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model
          ● You are free to select a different stock to analyze and news dataset as well while not changing the objective of the task.
